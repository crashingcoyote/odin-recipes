    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ramen noodles are a type of Japanese noodle dish that typically consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth, flavored with soy sauce, miso paste, or salt. The dish is often topped with various ingredients such as sliced pork, green onions, soft-boiled eggs, seaweed, and bamboo shoots, among others. Ramen noodles are a popular and relatively inexpensive fast food in Japan and have gained popularity in many other parts of the world. In recent years, different variations of ramen have emerged, including vegetarian and vegan options, as well as fusion-style dishes that incorporate different cultural flavors and ingredients.</p>
